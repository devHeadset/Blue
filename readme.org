* blue - gtk bluetooth manager

blue is a minimal bluetooth device manager written in c using gtk3, designed for linux (tested on nixos).  
it allows you to scan, pair, connect, and disconnect bluetooth devices via a simple graphical interface.

** features
- scan for nearby bluetooth devices  
- pair devices  
- connect to devices  
- disconnect devices  
- minimal gtk3 ui

** requirements
- gtk3 development libraries  
- bluetoothctl (bluez)  
- gcc and standard build tools  
- nix package manager (optional for easy building with flakes)

** building & running
if you use nix, simply run:

  #+begin_src sh
  nix run
  #+end_src

or compile manually:

  #+begin_src sh
  gcc main.c bluetooth.c gui.c -o blue `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0`
  #+end_src

then run:

  #+begin_src sh
  ./blue
  #+end_src

** file structure
- main.c          : app entry point  
- bluetooth.c/h   : bluetooth command wrappers and device management  
- gui.c/h         : gtk ui and event handlers  
- flake.nix       : nix flake for building and packaging

** notes
- the program relies on `bluetoothctl` command-line utility for device control.  
- you may need to run the app with appropriate permissions to control bluetooth devices.
